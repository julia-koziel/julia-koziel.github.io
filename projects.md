One of a Kind UK is a UK-based charity with the aim to help children and young people to reach their potential. We combine approaches from developmental psychology and neuroscience to identify and foster strengths and talents and develop targeted support for difficulties.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
