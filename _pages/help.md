We are looking for parents of both typically developing children, and children with neurodevelopmental conditions, who would be interested to download the app and test the games with their child, all in the comfort of their home.

By taking part, you'll help us to develop these games further and ensure that they are reliable measures of children's cognitive, emotional and social functioning.

Click [here](http://www.psyc.bbk.ac.uk/teachbrite/oneofakind/TimeTrekkers.html) to take part in the Time Trekkers study
