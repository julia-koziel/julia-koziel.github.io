We are currently working on three applications, each intended for a different age group, spanning from as early as 3 years of age to early adulthood. Read more about our projects below:

Pip and the Brain Explorers

Pip and the Brain Explorers is an application for pre-schoolers between the ages of 3 and 6 years. It follows the life of Pip and his friends and includes 10 fun games, where children get to find magic coins or play with a puppy.

Parents are given step-by-step instructions and demonstrations to play these games with their child.
