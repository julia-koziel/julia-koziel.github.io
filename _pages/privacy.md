Pip and the Brain Explorers Privacy Policy

This app has been developed as a part of a study funded by SFARI foundation and carried out by researchers at King’s College London. This study is focused on developing touch-screen tasks that measure cognitive processes in children in various age groups.  

This privacy notice outlines the practices that we use to collect, use, store or share any information that you may provide by using the app. It applies if you’re using any of the iPhone, iPad, Android Pip and the Brain Explorers applications or using our Pip and the Brain Explorers website.  The app services are intended for children between the ages of 6-11. We outline the privacy policy suitable that age group in a separate document titled Privacy Police for Children. We will always ask for the parent’s or guardian’s consent, before any information about the child is collected. In this Privacy Policy, we’ll explain what we do with the information you give us and which we may collect from you. 


The data we collect from you 

We obtain some data from you when you use or view our website, or use our app. By using these services, you agree to the privacy policy specifications. 

Information Collection 

Account information: The information you provide to us on the website will be linked with any data collected by the Pip and the Brain Explorers application. It will be saved with your unique ID code which only you know, therefore your child will not be personally identifiable by any of the data we will collect and store.   
Content you provide through our products: the services include the One of a Kind Charity web and the Pip and the Brain Explorers application you use, where we collect and store content and information that you save and share. This content includes information about how your child performs and responds while playing games included in the Pip and the Brain Explorers app e.g. how fast it takes them to complete a task. This content is always linked with the ID code and cannot be used to identify your child. No data is collected through automated means.


Information Use

To produce anonymised research reports that might be used for our service, or other purposes. For instance, data on how children perform on different games may be used to help us develop these games further. It may also be used in research publications or other research purposes. 
Feedback/ user support: we use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter and to repair and improve the services.
As required by applicable law, legal process or regulation.


Information sharing

We will not gather any personally-identifying information about your child.
Aggregated or de-identified data: we may disclose or use for any purpose aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you or your children. For example, we may share aggregated or de-identified information with colleagues at research institutions for research purposes, such as to compare the information gathered by the application with that gathered by standardised assessments, or by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our services.
To comply with laws: if we receive a request for information, we may disclose information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.
To enforce our rights, prevent fraud, and for safety: to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of One of a Kind Charity, or third parties, including enforcing contracts or policies, or in connection with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.
With consent: we may share information with third parties when we have consent to do so.

How long we keep information

Information you provide to us: all information and data you provide to us is kept indefinitely. 

Cookies, mobile device identifiers and web beacons

Cookies are files with a small amount of data. This service does not use these “cookies explicitly”.
