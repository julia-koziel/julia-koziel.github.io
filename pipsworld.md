Go-NoGo Task Breakdown
Pre-test: Motor Response
Bubble speed is varied, with response used to optimise the speed of the subsequent Go-NoGo task. Click here to learn more about the Bayesian Optimisation process, including a playable version of the game

Animated Cartoon
In the cartoon, the child is introduced to and familiarised with the task stimuli (puppy and cat), and given a sense of which is to be touched and which avoided

## Categorisation Demo The stimuli are introduced with symbols, a character (the scientist) and the parent both demonstrate to click the puppy

## Pre-test: Categorisation This pre-test determines base ability to distinguish the task stimuli and click the correct one

## Task Demo The scientist and parent both demonstrate how to play the game, this time with stimuli moving across the screen

## Task Practice The child is given a 10-trial practice, which can be repeated

## Main Task Consisting of 40 trials at optimised speed, the main task measures ability to inhibit motor response. If attention is lost and go-trials are missed, the puppy barks to re-engage the child.
